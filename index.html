<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am Matthew</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->


<div class="hero-image">

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am currently a senior at Pitt studying digital narrative and interactive design. Before this year, I was studying computer engineering, but decided it wasn't a great fit for me. I wanted to incorporate my more creative interests, such as music, into my studies, so, with the help of my advisor, I completed a minor in computer engineering and switched over to DNID. This fall, along with this class, I am taking CMPINF 0010: Big Ideas in Computing & Information, CMPINF 0401: Intermediate Programming, CS 0010: Intro to Computing, and ENGLIT 0512: Narrative and Technology. I am excited about two of my classes this year, this one and Narrative and Technology, and the reason I'm excited is pretty much the same for both. Last year I took Composing Digital Media with Professor Maverick, and hearing this class was building off of that somewhat was very exciting. I also get to take another class with Professor Maverick in Narrative and Technology.</h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>I already have a fair amount of coding and computer knowledge, coming from computer engineering, but outside of my academic life, I love music. I am in the marching band at Pitt, and I play the baritone. Outside of band, I can play guitar, bass, banjo, mandolin, and a little bit of ukelele and piano. I used to play trombone in high school, but its been a while. Last spring, for Composing Digital Media, I wrote a song for my final project in GarageBand. I hope to continue making music in the future and I am considering creating something music related for my project in this class. Below is the album cover I made for my song "Digital Heart."</h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

  <h2>Potential Project</h2>
      <h3>For my project, I want to do something muscic related. I'm not sure exactly what I want to make, but I want to make it interactive to some degree. Since it was mentioned that we were making some sort of animated character for this project my idea was to have said character helping the user through making a song out of various loops and transitions. I would probably make some sort of sample song, then let the user have fun with the loops.</h3>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path?

   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>In the future, I want to keep, making and playing music, but mostly as a hobby. Currently I'm itereested pursuing a career in CGI or VFX, for movies or games. I plan on taking some classes about computer graphics to see if the area seems like a good fit for me. I don't entirely know what I plan on doing but my main goal in the future is to be able to support a dog. In particular a big one, like my dog Ellie back home (pictured below).</h3>
